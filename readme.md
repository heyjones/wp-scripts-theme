# wp-scrips-theme

This boilerplate WordPress theme is based on wp-scripts. It comes with separate admin and theme builds out of the box, but additional builds can be appended by following the same pattern.

Each sample js/scss file has a comment explaining how my brain works and how I use this, but obviously do whatever works best for you.

I like this setup because I'm lazy.
